    const people = [
      { name: 'Wes', year: 1988 },
      { name: 'Kait', year: 1986 },
      { name: 'Irv', year: 1970 },

    // Some and Every Checks
    // Array.prototype.some() // is at least one person 19 or older?
    //the some method takes a function to check for something. We will need to check the actual year to calculate the age and then, it will return true if any of the objects match the condition
    const isAdult = people.some(person => ((new Date()).getFullYear()) - person.year >= 19);
    console.log(isAdult);
    // Array.prototype.every() // is everyone 19 or older?
    //the every works exactly the same as the some method, but will return true ONLY if ALL objects match the condition
    const allAdult = people.every(person => ((new Date()).getFullYear()) - person.year >= 19);
    console.log(allAdult);

    // Array.prototype.find()
    // Find is like filter, but instead returns just the one you are looking for
    // find the comment with the ID of 823423
    const comment = comments.find(comment => comment.id === 823423);
    console.log(comment);

    // Array.prototype.findIndex()
    // Find the comment with this ID
    // delete the comment with the ID of 823423
    //this method is useful when you need to delete something in an array, in order to delete something, you need to know where it is, in what position
    const index = comments.findIndex(comment => comment.id === 823423);
    console.log(index);
    //to delete something there is 2 ways of doing it:
    //comments.splice(index, 1); //this we are hardcoding the position of what we want to delete
    //the other option is to build a copy of the array you want to delete and don't include the item you want to delete:
    const newComments = [
      ...comments.slice(0, index), //you spread all itens from the array and go from the first position(0), to the index(that is the item you want to delete)
      ...comments.slice(index + 1) //and then from the index to the last position, so you don't loose anything
